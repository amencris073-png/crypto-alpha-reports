## 📉 Market Crash & Liquidations
The market has experienced a significant correction, with massive on-chain liquidations reported (e.g., "Insider Garrett" lost $600M). The sentiment is largely pessimistic, with the market described as a "dark forest" hunting down high-leverage positions.

## 🎒 Backpack Airdrop
Backpack announced a 25% token airdrop (24% to point holders, 1% to Mad Lads NFTs). Notably, there is no VC or market maker allocation, which has been praised by the community. Expected FDV is around $700M-$1B.

## ⛓️ On-Chain Opportunities & DeFi
- **Base Chain**: Remains active despite the downturn.
- **Hyperliquid**: Arbitrage opportunities between wHLP and HLP appeared.
