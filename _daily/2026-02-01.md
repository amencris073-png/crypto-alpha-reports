## 📉 Market Crash & Sentiment
**BTC Back to 70k Range**: Bitcoin fell to the 70k range for the first time since April 2025, with over $2.6B in liquidations across the network.
*   **Bearish View**: @Michael_Liu93 believes liquidity is tightening and advises waiting for "capitulation volume" and MVRV-Z < 0 before buying the dip.
*   **Bullish View**: @monkeyjiang sees strong support around 68k; Michael Saylor continues to tweet "More Orange".
*   **Action**: KOLs like @0xMilkRabbit are deleveraging and cutting losses.

## 🚀 Alpha & Opportunities
*   **Hyperliquid (wHLP) Arbitrage**: The crash caused HLP NAV to spike, while wHLP price lagged. Users like @BitHappy exploited this delay with loop lending to gain 6.7% in 1.5 hours.
*   **Backpack TGE**: Backpack announced its TGE with 25% airdrop to the community (no VC/MM allocation).
*   **Base Ecosystem**: High on-chain activity despite the downtrend.
    *   **Watchlist**: @SurfAI, @o1_exchange (trading comp), @openmind_agi.
    *   **Warning**: FUD surrounding Clanker/Proxy founders (allegations of past rugs).

## 👀 Trends
*   **Prediction Market Aggregators**: Increasing interest in aggregators like TradeFox and Converge due to Polymarket airdrop expectations.
*   **Domains**: AI Agent boom is driving up prices for domains like .xyz.
*   **OpenClaw**: Praised by @evilcos for its AI-generated security documentation.
