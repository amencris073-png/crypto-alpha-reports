**Time:** 20:50 UTC

## Highlights

### 1. ERC-8004 Standard: The "Diplomatic Passport" for AI Agents
Collaboratively released by the Ethereum Foundation, Google, MetaMask, and Coinbase. This standard provides a unified blueprint for on-chain identity verification, payments, and work validation for AI Agents. Analysts suggest .eth names will serve as diplomatic passports for robots; without verifiable identities, agents cannot gain trust in the decentralized economy. BNB Chain has also announced support.

### 2. Bitcoin Crash: Below $65,000
Bitcoin experienced sharp volatility, briefly dropping below $65,000. Over $1.4B - $1.8B in leveraged positions (mostly longs) were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Concerns center on institutional ETF outflows and miner selling. MicroStrategy's liquidation point is estimated around $62,000.

### 3. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Listings
Coinbase officially listed HYPE for spot trading and added it to the roadmap. While technical indicators suggest overbought conditions, on-chain data shows whales are accumulating. The narrative is shifting from listing hype to structural revaluation as a core L1 infrastructure.

### 4. Exchange Roadmap & New Assets
- **Coinbase**: Added Rainbow, RaveDAO, Aztec, and Espresso to the listing roadmap.
- **Robinhood**: Added support for Seeker ($SKR) and LayerZero ($ZRO).

### 5. Other Trending News
- **Entertainment**: BTS announced a comeback concert at Seoul's Gwanghwamun Square, to be streamed on Netflix.
- **Gaming**: Overwatch dropped the "2" suffix and plans a relaunch with 5 new heroes.
- **Market Sentiment**: "Bear Market Blues" discussions by Ledgerstatus highlight the stress of short-term liquidity despite long-term bullishness.
