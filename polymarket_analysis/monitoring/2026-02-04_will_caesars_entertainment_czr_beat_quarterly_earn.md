## Analysis: Will Caesars Entertainment (CZR) beat quarterly earnings?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: This event exhibits a low level of cyclicality, as earnings releases are typically quarterly and do not follow a daily or weekly pattern. However, the event is tied to a specific quarterly earnings release, which may create some periodic patterns. Nevertheless, the cyclicality is not significant enough to be considered high.
- **Automation**: Yes, the outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The resolution source is the company's official earnings documents, and if not available, SeekingAlpha's reported GAAP EPS figure can be used. Both sources can be accessed programmatically.
- **Suitability Score**: 7
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its suitability is limited by the low cyclicality. The automation of outcome data retrieval is a positive factor, making it easier to monitor and react to the event's resolution.

Technical Note:
To automate the retrieval of outcome data, one can use APIs or web scraping techniques to access the company's official earnings documents or SeekingAlpha's reported GAAP EPS figure. Some possible APIs for this purpose include:
- EDGAR API (US Securities and Exchange Commission) for accessing company filings
- SeekingAlpha API for accessing earnings data
- Financial data providers like Quandl or Alpha Vantage for accessing earnings data

Please note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the chosen programming language and API providers.
