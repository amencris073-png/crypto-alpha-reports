## Analysis: Charlie Puth 'Whatever's Clever!' First Week Album Sales?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: Low - Album releases are not recurring events with predictable patterns, and sales figures can be influenced by various factors such as marketing campaigns, competition, and audience reception.
- **Automation**: Yes - The outcome data can be automatically retrieved from the "HITS TOP 50" list on Hits Daily Double, specifically from the "Activity" column. However, this may require web scraping or monitoring of the website for updates.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: While the automation criterion is met, the lack of cyclicality and predictability in album sales makes this event less suitable for trading. Nevertheless, it can still be monitored for potential trading opportunities.

Technical Note:
To automate data retrieval for this event, you can use web scraping techniques with libraries like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Scrapy (Python). You would need to:
1. Monitor the Hits Daily Double website for updates on the "HITS TOP 50" list.
2. Parse the HTML content to extract the "Activity" column data for Charlie Puth's album.
3. Store the extracted data for analysis and trading decisions.
Please note that web scraping may be subject to terms of service and robots.txt restrictions. Always ensure you comply with these regulations before implementing any automation.
