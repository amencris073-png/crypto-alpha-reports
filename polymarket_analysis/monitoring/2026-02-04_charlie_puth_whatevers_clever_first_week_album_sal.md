## Analysis: Charlie Puth 'Whatever's Clever!' First Week Album Sales?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. The album release is a one-time event, and the sales data will be available only once, after the debut week. While album releases can follow a certain pattern (e.g., typically on Fridays), this does not impact the trading suitability of this specific event.
- **Automation**: Yes. The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The resolution source, Hits Daily Double, provides a publicly accessible website with the "HITS TOP 50" list, which includes the required sales data. Web scraping or API integration can be used to retrieve the data once it becomes available.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its suitability is limited by the lack of cyclicality. The outcome is a one-time event, and the data will be available only once. However, the automation aspect makes it possible to retrieve the data efficiently.

Technical Note: To automate the data retrieval, a web scraping script can be used to extract the sales data from the "HITS TOP 50" list on the Hits Daily Double website. The script can be set up to run periodically until the data becomes available, and then retrieve the sales figure for Charlie Puth's album "Whatever's Clever!". Alternatively, if Hits Daily Double provides an API, it can be used to retrieve the data programmatically.
