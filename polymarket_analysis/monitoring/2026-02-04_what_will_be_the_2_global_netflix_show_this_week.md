## Analysis: What will be the #2 global Netflix show this week?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: The event exhibits a weekly pattern, as Netflix updates its global Top 10 TV shows list every week on Tuesday, reflecting viewership from the previous week (Monday to Sunday). However, the outcome of the event (the #2 global Netflix show) is difficult to predict and may not follow a recurring pattern.
- **Automation**: Yes, the outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. Netflix publishes its Top 10 list on top10.netflix.com, which can be scraped or accessed through APIs.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: While the event exhibits a weekly pattern and the outcome data can be automatically retrieved, the unpredictability of the #2 global Netflix show makes it less suitable for trading. The event is more suitable for monitoring, as the outcome can be automatically tracked, but the lack of a clear pattern makes it challenging to make informed trading decisions.

Technical Note: To automate the retrieval of the outcome data, one can use web scraping techniques or access the Netflix API (if available). A script can be written to periodically check the top10.netflix.com page for updates and extract the #2 global Netflix show. This data can then be used to resolve the market and update trading positions.
