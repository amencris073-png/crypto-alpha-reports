## Analysis: Will Moderna (MRNA) beat quarterly earnings?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: This event exhibits a quarterly pattern, as earnings reports are typically released on a quarterly basis. However, the exact date and time of the earnings release may vary, and the event's outcome is not directly influenced by recurring patterns. Therefore, cyclicality is considered Low.
- **Automation**: The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages, such as SeekingAlpha or the company's official earnings documents. Automation is considered Yes.
- **Suitability Score**: 7
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its quarterly pattern and potential variability in earnings release dates and times make it less predictable than events with higher cyclicality. Automation is feasible, making it easier to retrieve outcome data.

Technical Note: To automate this event, one can use web scraping techniques or APIs to retrieve the GAAP EPS figure from SeekingAlpha or the company's official earnings documents. A script can be set up to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes) on the day of the earnings release to check for updates. Once the GAAP EPS figure is retrieved, it can be compared to the strike price of $-2.60 to determine the event's outcome.
