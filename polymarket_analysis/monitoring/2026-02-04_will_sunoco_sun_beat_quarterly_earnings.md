## Analysis: Will Sunoco (SUN) beat quarterly earnings?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: Low - This event is tied to a specific quarterly earnings release, which is a relatively infrequent occurrence. While earnings releases do follow a somewhat regular schedule, the specific date and time may vary from quarter to quarter. Additionally, the outcome of this event is heavily dependent on various market and economic factors, making it difficult to identify significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns.
- **Automation**: Yes - The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages, such as SeekingAlpha or the company's official earnings documents. These sources typically provide the necessary information in a structured format, making it feasible to automate the data retrieval process.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its suitability is limited by the lack of significant cyclicality. The outcome is heavily dependent on various market and economic factors, making it challenging to identify reliable patterns. However, the automation of outcome data retrieval is feasible, which makes it a monitoring-type event.

Technical Note: To automate this event, one can use web scraping techniques or APIs to retrieve the GAAP EPS figure from SeekingAlpha or the company's official earnings documents. The retrieved data can then be compared to the strike price ($1.62) to determine the outcome of the event. Some possible APIs for retrieving earnings data include:
* SeekingAlpha API
* Quandl API
* Alpha Vantage API
* Intrinio API

Please note that the specific API or web scraping approach may require additional development and testing to ensure reliable and accurate data retrieval.
