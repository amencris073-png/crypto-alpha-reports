Technical Note: To automate this event, one can use web scraping techniques or APIs to retrieve the GAAP EPS figure from SeekingAlpha or the company's official earnings documents. A script can be set up to run at the estimated earnings release time to fetch the data and compare it to the strike price. If the data is not available within the specified time frame, the script can resolve the market to "No" according to the rules.
