## Analysis: When will DHS receive full-year funding?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: Low - The event is based on a specific legislative process, which does not follow a regular daily, weekly, or monthly pattern. While the US Congress has a schedule and budget cycles, the timing of legislation passing both the House and the Senate, and being signed by the President, is unpredictable and subject to various factors such as negotiations, amendments, and external events.
- **Automation**: Yes - The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages from official sources like the Library of Congress (congress.gov). It is possible to monitor the status of legislation and receive updates on its progress through web scraping or APIs.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its unpredictability and lack of cyclicality make it less attractive for quantitative strategies. However, it can be monitored and traded based on market sentiment and reaction to news and updates on the legislative process.

Technical Note: To automate the monitoring of this event, one can use web scraping techniques to extract data from congress.gov or utilize APIs provided by the Library of Congress or other government sources. For example, the Congress API (api.congress.gov) offers access to legislative data, including bill status and updates. A script can be set up to periodically check the status of relevant legislation and send notifications or update a database when changes occur.
