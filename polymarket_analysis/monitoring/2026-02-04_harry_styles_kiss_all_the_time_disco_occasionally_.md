## Analysis: Harry Styles 'Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally' First Week Album Sales?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. While album releases can follow a somewhat predictable schedule, the sales figures are influenced by various factors such as marketing campaigns, fan engagement, and cultural trends, making it difficult to identify a consistent pattern.
- **Automation**: Yes, the outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The primary resolution source, Hits Daily Double, provides a publicly accessible website with the "HITS TOP 50" list, which includes the necessary sales data. This data can be scraped or retrieved through web automation tools.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is moderately suitable for trading due to the availability of automation, but its lack of cyclicality makes it less predictable. The sales figures for the album's debut week are subject to various factors, making it challenging to make informed trading decisions.

Technical Note:
To automate the retrieval of sales data, one can use web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup (Python) or Scrapy (Python). The process would involve:

1. Sending an HTTP request to the Hits Daily Double website.
2. Parsing the HTML content of the page using a web scraping library.
3. Extracting the sales data from the "HITS TOP 50" list.
4. Storing the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for further analysis.

Please note that web scraping should be done in accordance with the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.
