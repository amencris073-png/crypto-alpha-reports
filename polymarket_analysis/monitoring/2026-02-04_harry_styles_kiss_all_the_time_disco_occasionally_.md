## Analysis: Harry Styles 'Kiss All The Time. Disco, Occasionally' First Week Album Sales?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. The album release is a one-time event, and the sales data will be available only once, after the debut week. While album sales can be influenced by various factors like marketing campaigns, concerts, or holidays, these factors do not create a predictable cyclic pattern for this specific event.
- **Automation**: Yes, the outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The resolution source, Hits Daily Double, provides a publicly accessible website with the "HITS TOP 50" list, which includes the required sales data. Web scraping or API integration can be used to retrieve the data once it becomes available.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is suitable for trading, but its suitability is limited by the lack of cyclicality. The outcome is not predictable based on historical patterns, making it more challenging to make informed trading decisions. However, the automation of data retrieval is feasible, which reduces the risk of disputes or manual errors in resolving the market.

Technical Note: To automate the data retrieval, a web scraping script can be set up to periodically check the "HITS TOP 50" list on the Hits Daily Double website. Once the album's debut week sales data becomes available, the script can extract the relevant information and update the market outcome. Alternatively, if Hits Daily Double provides an API, it can be integrated to retrieve the data programmatically.
