## Analysis: What will Eli Lilly say during their next earnings call?

- **Category**: Monitoring
- **Cyclicality**: Low - While earnings calls are recurring events, the content discussed during these calls is not cyclical and does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. The outcome of this event is highly dependent on the specific context and information shared during the call.
- **Automation**: Yes - The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages that provide access to the earnings call transcript or audio recording. However, some natural language processing (NLP) would be required to analyze the content and determine if the listed term is mentioned.
- **Suitability Score**: 6
- **Reasoning**: This event is somewhat suitable for trading, but its suitability is limited by the lack of cyclical patterns and the need for NLP to automate the data retrieval process. The outcome is also subjective, as it depends on the context and information shared during the call.

Technical Note: To automate this event, one could use NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy to analyze the earnings call transcript or audio recording. The script would need to be trained to recognize the listed term and its variants (e.g., pluralization, possessive forms) and compound words. Additionally, the script would need to account for the specific rules outlined in the event description, such as counting full-name mentions as one mention.
