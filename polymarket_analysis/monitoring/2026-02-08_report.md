## 🎵 Billboard Hot 100

- **Current #1**: "Aperture" - Harry Styles
- **Polymarket Market**: [Billboard Hot 100 #1 Song Week of February 14](https://polymarket.com/event/billboard-hot-100-1-song-week-of-february-14)
- **Discrepancy**: **CRITICAL**. Polymarket odds for "Aperture" are <1% (0.4c), despite it being the current #1 song and leading candidate for the Feb 14 chart. Market is heavily favoring older hits like "I Just Might" (Bruno Mars).
