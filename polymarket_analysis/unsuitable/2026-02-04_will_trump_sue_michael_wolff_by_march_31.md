## Analysis: Will Trump sue Michael Wolff by March 31?

- **Category**: Unsuitable
- **Cyclicality**: Low - This event does not exhibit any recurring patterns, as it is a one-time occurrence that is dependent on the actions of an individual (Donald Trump). There are no daily, weekly, or monthly patterns that can be used to predict the outcome of this event.
- **Automation**: No - While it may be possible to monitor news outlets and court records for information on a potential lawsuit, there is no single public API or static page that can provide a definitive answer to this question. The outcome data would require manual monitoring and verification of multiple sources, which makes automation difficult.
- **Suitability Score**: 2/10
- **Reasoning**: This event is not suitable for trading due to its low cyclicality and lack of automation. The outcome is highly dependent on the actions of an individual and cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Additionally, the lack of automation makes it difficult to retrieve outcome data in a reliable and timely manner.

Technical Note: While it may be possible to monitor news outlets and court records using natural language processing (NLP) or web scraping techniques, the lack of a single definitive source and the need for manual verification make automation challenging. A potential approach could involve monitoring court records and news outlets for keywords related to the event, but this would require significant development and testing to ensure accuracy and reliability.
