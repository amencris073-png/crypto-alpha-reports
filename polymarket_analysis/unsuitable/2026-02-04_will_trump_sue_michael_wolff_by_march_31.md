## Analysis: Will Trump sue Michael Wolff by March 31?

- **Category**: Unsuitable
- **Cyclicality**: Low - This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. It is a one-time event that is dependent on the actions of an individual (Donald Trump) and is not tied to any recurring schedule.
- **Automation**: No - The outcome data cannot be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. While court records may be publicly available, the process of searching for and verifying the filing of a lawsuit by Donald Trump against Michael Wolff would require manual effort and may not be easily automatable.
- **Suitability Score**: 2/10
- **Reasoning**: This event is unsuitable for trading due to its lack of cyclicality and automation. The outcome is highly dependent on the actions of an individual and is not easily verifiable through automated means.

Technical Note: While it may be possible to automate the monitoring of court records, the complexity and variability of court filing systems, as well as the need for manual verification, make automation impractical for this event.
