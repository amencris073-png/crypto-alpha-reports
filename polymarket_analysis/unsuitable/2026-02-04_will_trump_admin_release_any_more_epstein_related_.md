## Analysis: Will Trump admin release any more Epstein related files by...?

- **Category**: Unsuitable
- **Cyclicality**: Low - This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. The release of Epstein-related files by the Trump Administration is a one-time event that may or may not occur within the specified timeframe. There is no recurring pattern or schedule for such releases.
- **Automation**: No - The outcome data cannot be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The primary resolution source for this market is official information from the government of the United States, which may be published in various formats and locations, such as official government websites, press releases, or FOIA reading rooms. While some government data may be available through APIs or static pages, the specific information relevant to this event is unlikely to be easily accessible in a machine-readable format.
- **Suitability Score**: 2/10
- **Reasoning**: This event is unsuitable for trading due to its low cyclicality and lack of automation. The outcome is highly uncertain and dependent on various factors, including government decisions and actions, which cannot be easily predicted or monitored.

Technical Note: Automating the monitoring of this event would require natural language processing (NLP) and web scraping techniques to track official government publications and announcements. However, even with these techniques, it may be challenging to accurately detect and classify relevant information, especially if it is published in various formats or locations.
