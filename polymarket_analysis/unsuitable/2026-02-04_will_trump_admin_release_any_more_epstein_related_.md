## Analysis: Will Trump admin release any more Epstein related files by...?

- **Category**: Unsuitable
- **Cyclicality**: Low - The event is based on a one-time release of information by the Trump Administration and does not exhibit recurring patterns. The release of Epstein-related files is not a regular or scheduled event, making it difficult to identify any daily, weekly, or monthly patterns.
- **Automation**: No - The outcome data cannot be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. The primary resolution source is official information from the government of the United States, which may not be easily accessible or machine-readable. Additionally, the market allows for a consensus of credible reporting as a resolution source, which would require manual monitoring and evaluation of news articles and other sources.
- **Suitability Score**: 2/10
- **Reasoning**: This event is not suitable for trading due to the lack of cyclicality and automation. The release of Epstein-related files is a one-time event that cannot be predicted with certainty, and the outcome data cannot be easily retrieved or automated.

Technical Note: Automating this event would require advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to monitor news articles and government releases, as well as the ability to evaluate the credibility of sources. Even with these capabilities, the lack of a structured data source and the subjective nature of the event resolution make automation challenging.
