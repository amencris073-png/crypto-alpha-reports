## Analysis: Will Trump admin release any more Epstein related files by...?

- **Category**: Unsuitable
- **Cyclicality**: Low - This event does not exhibit significant daily, weekly, or monthly patterns. The release of Epstein-related files by the Trump Administration is a one-time event that may or may not occur within the specified timeframe. There is no recurring pattern or schedule for such releases.
- **Automation**: No - The outcome data cannot be automatically retrieved via public APIs or static pages. While official government websites and press releases may be monitored, determining whether a release qualifies as a "Yes" event requires manual evaluation of the content and context of the release. Additionally, the possibility of leaks or unofficial disclosures that may not be attributable to the Executive Branch adds complexity to automating the outcome.
- **Suitability Score**: 2/10
- **Reasoning**: This event is unsuitable for trading due to its low cyclicality and lack of automation. The outcome is highly dependent on manual evaluation and may be influenced by subjective factors, making it difficult to predict or automate.

Technical Note: While it may be possible to monitor official government websites and press releases for releases related to Epstein, automating the evaluation of these releases would require advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to determine whether the content meets the market's criteria. Even with NLP, the complexity of evaluating the context and content of releases would likely require human oversight, making automation impractical.
