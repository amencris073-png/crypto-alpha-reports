 ## Analysis: Reserve Bank of Australia Decision in May?

- **Category**: Quantitative
- **Cyclicality**: High. The RBA Monetary Policy Board meets on a fixed schedule (monthly, typically the first Tuesday of each month except January). This creates a predictable, recurring event cycle with known dates published years in advance. May meetings are a standard fixture in the economic calendar.
- **Automation**: Yes. The RBA publishes the cash rate decision via official media releases on their website (rba.gov.au) immediately after the meeting concludes (typically 2:30 PM AEST). The target rate is disclosed as a specific numerical value (e.g., "4.35 per cent") in a standardized format, making it easily parseable via web scraping or RSS feeds.
- **Suitability Score**: 9/10
- **Reasoning**: This is a textbook quantitative event. It combines a rigidly scheduled cyclical event (monthly central bank meeting) with an objective, publicly available numerical outcome (the cash rate target) released through official channels. The resolution criteria (change relative to previous rate) is mathematically deterministic with no subjective interpretation required. The only minor limitation is the long time horizon (May 2026), which affects liquidity but not the event's structural suitability for automated trading systems.

**Technical Note**: Automate by monitoring the RBA Media Releases page (`https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/`) or the specific Board Minutes section on the meeting date. The scraper should look for the phrase "cash rate target" or "target for the cash rate" followed by the percentage value. Implement a polling mechanism starting at 14:30 AEST on May 5, 2026, with fallback logic to the "No Change" bracket if no release is detected by the subsequent meeting date (as per resolution rules).
