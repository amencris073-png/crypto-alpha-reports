 ## Analysis: Billboard 200 #1 Album Week of February 14

- **Category**: Quantitative
- **Cyclicality**: High - The Billboard 200 follows a strict weekly publication cycle, releasing every Tuesday (with rare holiday adjustments) and dated for the upcoming Saturday. This creates a predictable, recurring event structure that occurs 52 times annually, allowing for systematic modeling of music consumption patterns and chart dynamics.
- **Automation**: Yes - The resolution data is published publicly on billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/ in a structured, standardized format. The #1 album (title and artist) can be extracted definitively via web scraping or unofficial APIs (e.g., Python `billboard.py` library). The "Other" resolution condition (14-day delay) is also programmatically verifiable by checking for chart publication.
- **Suitability Score**: 8/10
- **Reasoning**: This event exhibits ideal characteristics for quantitative trading: a cyclical release schedule, objective resolution criteria (unambiguous #1 ranking based on sales/streaming data), and publicly accessible structured data. The primary limitation is potential fragility in web scrapers if Billboard modifies their site architecture, though this is mitigated by the data's wide availability across third-party aggregators.

**Technical Note**: Deploy a scheduled scraper for Tuesday, February 10, 2026 (expected release date for the "Week of February 14" chart). Target the specific chart URL structure or use a headless browser (Playwright/Puppeteer) to handle JavaScript-rendered content. Extract the first position from the chart list and validate against the chart date header. Implement a 14-day polling loop to check for publication delays, defaulting to "Other" if the February 14-dated chart remains absent by February 24, 2026.
