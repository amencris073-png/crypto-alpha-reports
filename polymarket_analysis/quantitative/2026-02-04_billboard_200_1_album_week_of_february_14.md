Technical Note: To automate data retrieval, a web scraper can be set up to extract the relevant information from the Billboard website. Specifically, the scraper can target the HTML elements containing the chart data and update the information accordingly. Additionally, Billboard may provide APIs or RSS feeds for accessing their data, which can be leveraged for automation. However, the exact implementation would require further investigation into Billboard's data access policies and technical infrastructure.
