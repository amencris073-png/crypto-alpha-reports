## Analysis: Billboard 200 #1 Album Week of February 14

- **Category**: Quantitative
- **Cyclicality**: High - The Billboard 200 chart is updated every Tuesday, reflecting data from the previous week. This creates a recurring pattern that can be anticipated and prepared for.
- **Automation**: Yes - The outcome data can be automatically retrieved via the Billboard website (https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/), which is a publicly accessible static page. The chart is published regularly, and the data can be scraped or retrieved through a web API.
- **Suitability Score**: 9
- **Reasoning**: This event exhibits high cyclicality due to its regular weekly updates, and the outcome data can be easily retrieved through automation. This makes it an attractive event for trading, as the outcome can be quickly determined and the data is reliable.

Technical Note: To automate the retrieval of the Billboard 200 chart data, a web scraping script can be written to extract the relevant information from the Billboard website. Alternatively, if Billboard provides an API for accessing their chart data, this can be used to retrieve the information programmatically. The script can be set to run on Tuesdays, shortly after the chart is published, to retrieve the latest data and determine the outcome of the event.
