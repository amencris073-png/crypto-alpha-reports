# 📊 Polymarket 事件分析报告

## 📝 基础信息
- **问题**: Kasımpaşa SK vs. Fatih Karagümrük SK - More Markets
- **描述**: More markets for the Süper Lig game, scheduled for February 16 at 12:00 PM ET.

## 🔍 规则分析
1. **周期性**: This is a one-time scheduled football match without recurring patterns or seasonality that can be modeled for systematic prediction. Sporting events are discrete, independent occurrences rather than cyclical time-series data.
2. **自动化**: Match outcomes and statistics are available through numerous public sports APIs (Football-Data.org, SportsMonks, API-Football), the official Süper Lig website, and major sports data providers like ESPN. Settlement data is standardized, real-time, and highly reliable.

## 🎯 分类结果
**分类**: **monitoring**
**核心结论**: A standard one-off football match with easily accessible settlement data, suitable for event-driven monitoring but not quantitative cyclical modeling.

## 💡 自动化执行方案
- **执行逻辑**: Deploy cross-platform odds comparison across Polymarket and traditional sportsbooks to identify pre-match and in-play arbitrage opportunities; set automated alerts for significant line movements; verify settlement via multiple sports data API endpoints post-match.
