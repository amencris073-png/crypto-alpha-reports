# 📊 Polymarket 事件分析报告

## 📝 基础信息
- **问题**: Bulls vs. Nets
- **描述**: In the upcoming NBA game, scheduled for February 9 at 7:30PM ET:
If the Bulls win, the market will resolve to "Bulls".
If the Nets win, the market will resolve to "Nets".
If the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.
If the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.
The result will be determined based on the final score including any overtime periods.

## 🔍 规则分析
1. **周期性**: This is a single scheduled NBA game, not a recurring event with cyclical patterns. While NBA games happen regularly during a season, this specific Bulls vs. Nets market is a one-off, discrete event that resolves permanently after February 9. There are no exploitable daily, weekly, or monthly cycles for statistical arbitrage on this individual market.
2. **自动化**: Settlement data (final game score and winner) is universally available through reliable public APIs (NBA.com, ESPN, sportsdata.io) and static web pages immediately after game completion. The binary outcome is deterministic and verifiable, enabling fully automated data ingestion, result validation, and trade execution with zero ambiguity.

## 🎯 分类结果
**分类**: **monitoring**
**核心结论**: Non-cyclical but data-rich event perfect for algorithmic monitoring and event-driven arbitrage against sportsbook odds or live win-probability models.

## 💡 自动化执行方案
- **执行逻辑**: Deploy pre-game pricing arbitrage by scraping Vegas/sportsbook odds; monitor live in-game win-probability APIs (e.g., 538, inpredictable) to delta-hedge when Polymarket odds diverge >3%; auto-settle positions via NBA official API post-game. Implement circuit breakers for postponement risk.
