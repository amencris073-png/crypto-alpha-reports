# 📊 Polymarket 事件分析报告

## 📝 基础信息
- **问题**: U.S. strike on Somalia by February 28?
- **描述**: This market will resolve to "Yes" if a US-initiated drone, missile, or air strike on the soil of Somalia is announced or credibly reported to have occurred between market creation and the listed date ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to "No".

For the purposes of this market, a qualifying "strike" is defined as the use of aerial bombs, drones, or missiles (including FPV and ATGM strikes as well as cruise or ballistic missiles) launched by any United States operatives, including military forces, intelligence agencies, or other U.S. government operatives, that physically impact ground territory within the listed country.

A strike on any area within the terrestrial territory (including rivers, lakes, ports, but excluding territorial sea) of the listed country counts.

Missiles or drones that are intercepted and surface-to-air missile strikes will not be sufficient for a "Yes" resolution, regardless of whether they land in the listed country’s territory or cause damage.

Actions such as artillery fire, small arms fire, ground incursions, naval shelling, or cyberattacks will not qualify.

Any strike occurring during this market’s timeframe that is claimed by either Donald Trump or the U.S. government will qualify.

The primary resolution source will be a consensus of credible reporting and government sources.

This market may remain open until the end of the second day after the resolution time. If the date/time of a qualifying strike cannot be confirmed by a consensus of credible reporting by that time, it will resolve to "No" regardless of whether a strike was later confirmed to have taken place.

## 🔍 规则分析
1. **周期性**: 军事打击属于偶发性地缘政治事件，完全取决于美国政府的即时决策和情报行动，不存在任何可预测的周期性规律。
2. **自动化**: 该事件的确认完全依赖公开新闻源和政府声明，可通过API（如新闻专线、Twitter/X、DoD RSS）和网页抓取实现自动化监控。信息一旦发布即公开透明，仅对监控速度要求极高。

## 🎯 分类结果
**分类**: **monitoring**
**核心结论**: 非周期性但可通过新闻监控实现自动化的事件驱动型市场。

## 💡 自动化执行方案
- **执行逻辑**: 建立低延迟新闻监控系统，实时抓取白宫、国防部、主流媒体及通讯社信源，使用NLP识别打击关键词，在共识报道形成前抢跑交易，同时需设置多源交叉验证防误判机制。
