# 📊 Polymarket 事件分析报告

## 📝 基础信息
- **问题**: Will Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) beat quarterly earnings?
- **描述**: As of market creation, Tower Semiconductor is estimated to release earnings on February 11, 2026. The Street consensus estimate for Tower Semiconductor's GAAP EPS for the relevant quarter is $0.59 as of market creation. This market will resolve to "Yes" if Tower Semiconductor reports GAAP EPS greater than $0.59 for the relevant quarter in its next quarterly earnings release. Otherwise, it will resolve to "No." The resolution source will be the GAAP EPS listed in the company’s official earnings documents. 

If Tower Semiconductor releases earnings without GAAP EPS, then the market will resolve according to the GAAP EPS figure reported by SeekingAlpha. If no such figure is published within 96h of market close (4:00:00pm ET) on the day earnings are announced, the market will resolve to “No”.

If the company does not release earnings within 45 calendar days of the estimated earnings date, this market will resolve to “No.” 

Note: Subsequent restatements, corrections, or revisions made to the initially announced GAAP EPS figure will not qualify for resolution, except in the case of obvious and immediate mistakes (e.g., fat finger errors, as with Lyft's (LYFT) earnings release in February 2024).
Note: The strike prices used in these markets are derived from SeekingAlpha estimates, and reflect the consensus of sell-side analyst estimates for GAAP EPS. 
Note: All figures will be rounded to the nearest cent using standard rounding.
Note: For the purposes of this market, IFRS EPS will be treated as GAAP EPS.
Note: For the purposes of this market, GAAP EPS refers to diluted GAAP EPS, unless this is not published, in which case it refers to basic GAAP EPS.
Note: All figures are expressed in USD, unless otherwise indicated.
Note: For primarily internationally listed companies, this market refers specifically to the shares traded in the United States on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE or Nasdaq. In cases where the company trades in the U.S. through an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) or American Depositary Share (ADS), this market will refer to the ADR/ADS.


## 🔍 规则分析
1. **周期性**: Quarterly earnings are released once per quarter (≈3‑month cycle), not daily or weekly. While the event is predictable within a given earnings season, it does not repeat on a short‑term basis, making it unsuitable for high‑frequency quantitative arbitrage.
2. **自动化**: The GAAP EPS figure appears in the company's official earnings release, SEC filings (e.g., 8‑K), and on financial data sites such as SeekingAlpha. These sources can be accessed via public APIs or web‑scraping, allowing a bot to retrieve the number automatically shortly after the announcement.

## 🎯 分类结果
**分类**: **monitoring**
**核心结论**: A low‑frequency, event‑driven market with publicly available and easily retrievable data; best suited for automated monitoring and rapid execution when the EPS is announced.

## 💡 自动化执行方案
- **执行逻辑**: Monitor Tower Semiconductor's earnings release (expected after market close on Feb 11 2026). Parse the GAAP EPS value from the official document or SeekingAlpha. If EPS > $0.59, buy 'Yes' shares; if EPS ≤ $0.59 or the figure is missing within 96 hours, buy 'No' shares. Execute the trade as soon as the data is confirmed to capture price movement before the market resolves.
