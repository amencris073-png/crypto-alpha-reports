# 📊 Polymarket 事件分析报告

## 📝 基础信息
- **问题**: Oklahoma Sooners vs. Vanderbilt Commodores (W)
- **描述**: This event is for the WBB game between Oklahoma Sooners and Vanderbilt Commodores on February 9 at 9:00 PM ET.

If the game is postponed, this market will remain open until the game has been completed.

If the game is canceled entirely, with no make-up game, this market will resolve 50-50.

## 🔍 规则分析
1. **周期性**: This is a one-time college basketball game (WBB = Women's Basketball) with no recurring pattern. While NCAA games occur within a seasonal schedule, this specific Oklahoma vs Vanderbilt matchup is an isolated event that does not repeat in a predictable cycle exploitable for systematic arbitrage. Sporting events of this nature lack the periodic regularity required for quantitative cyclical modeling.
2. **自动化**: Game outcomes and real-time scores are readily available through multiple public data sources including ESPN APIs, NCAA official feeds, Sports Reference, and other sports data providers. These sources offer both programmatic API access and scrapable static pages. Resolution conditions (completion, postponement, or cancellation) are unambiguous and easily verifiable through official NCAA or university athletic department announcements.

## 🎯 分类结果
**分类**: **monitoring**
**核心结论**: Single non-cyclical sporting event with trivially accessible outcome data, ideal for event-driven monitoring but not cyclical quantitative modeling.

## 💡 自动化执行方案
- **执行逻辑**: Deploy API polling from sports data providers (e.g., ESPN, SportsDataIO) to track live win probabilities and compare against Polymarket odds for arbitrage detection; monitor for resolution status changes (postponement/cancellation) via official NCAA channels; execute trades when significant deviations from benchmark sportsbook odds are detected.
